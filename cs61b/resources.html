            <p><b>Note: </b>This page will likely change as I get more time to work on this, but I'll try not to move too many things around.  Additionally, these are unofficial resources that I am posting up which have not been quality-checked by the rest of the CS61B course staff.</p>
            <p>Official course resources can be found on the <a href="http://berkeley-cs61b.github.io/public_html/resources.html">Resources section</a> of the CS61B website.</p>
            
            <h2>Teaching (Spring 2015)</h2>

            </ul>

            <h2 id="resources">Interview Resources</h2>
            <p>This is by no means a comprehensive list of resources, and was quickly thrown together in about 30 minutes before my discussion section for the week.  I will try to find time to polish these a little bit in the near future.</p>

            <p><a href="res/prep_for_the_trivial.pdf">Technical Interview Workshop (Prepare for the Trivial)</a></p>
            <p>These are some notes that I took from an interview workshop which was hosted by <a href="http://www.hackersatberkeley.com">Hackers at Berkeley</a> back in March 2012.  I'll try to clean it up and make it more understandable as I have time.  This was the workshop where I first learned the basics of tech interviews.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.careercup.com/book"><i>Cracking the Coding Interview</i> (Gayle McDowell)</a></p>
            <p>This is an excellent book with many, many practice questions.  It is also a good resource for reviewing a lot of material that is common in technical interviews.</p>

            <p><a href="http://beust.com/algorithms.pdf"><i>Algorithms</i> (Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani)</a></p>
            <p>This is a draft version of the textbook that is used in UC Berkeley's CS270 course.  Most of these I wouldn't worry too much about until you are a junior.  The most important things you will probably see in technical interviews are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Asymptotic Analysis (incl. Master's Theorem)</p></li>
                <li><p>Search Algorithms: Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Djikstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm</p></li>
                <li><p>Dynamic Programming</p></li>
                <li><p>NP-Hard Problems and Reductions</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The problems in this book are hard!  You'll encounter plenty of them when you take CS170.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.glassdoor.com">Glassdoor</a></p>
            <p>This is a website with reviews about companies to work for.  You will often find examples of some interview problems which serve as good practice.  Go through these not with the intention of trying to memorize past interview questions -- it is painfully clear if you are trying to fake that you have not seen a certain interview question, and honestly, your time would be better spent doing other preparation -- but so that you get an idea of what level of questions to expect.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com">Topcoder</a></p>
            <p>Another good resource for plenty of interview questions.</p>

            <p><a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html">Get That Job at Google (Steve Yegge)</a></p>
            <p>This is a blog post that I was linked to as an interview prep resource by a Google recruiter.  You may find this helpful.</p>

            <!-- Practice Set 1 -->
            <h3 id="set1q">Practice Set 1</h3>
            <p><b>Released: </b>March 10, 2015  (<a href="set1_ans.html">Solutions</a>)</p>
            <p><i>These questions have been modified and adapted from interview questions I have seen before.</i></p>
            <p>For each of the below questions, remember to: (1) talk through a high-level algorithmic idea, (2) code in the language of your choice, (3) check your code with some test cases, and (4) discuss the runtime and space complexities of your solution.  At first, focus on just getting a solution that is reasonably efficient; you can always go back and optimize your code later.  The times I have included are rough target times; don't worry too much about these.</p>
            
            <p><b>Question 1. </b>(15 min) Implement a function <span class="code">pow(a, b)</span> which takes in two integers \(a\) and \(b\) and computes \(a^{b}\).  You may assume that \(b\) is a non-negative integer.</p>
            
            <p><b>Question 2a. </b>(10 min) Consider a scenario where you have a String, a starting index, and an ending index.  Write a function which counts the number of spaces between the two indices, inclusive.</p>

            <p><b>Question 2b. </b>(15 min)  Now let's say we have a really long String and it doesn't change (the indices, however, may be different each time).  You will be running many queries on this String.  How would write a more efficient solution?</p>

            <p>For each of the below, you may assume that you have a <span class="code">TreeNode</span> class which knows its parent, its left child, its right child, and its value.  If you need any additional behavior, you will need to write the code yourself.</p>

            <p><b>Question 1. </b>(20 min) Implement a function which takes as input a preorder traversal and inorder traversal of a binary tree, and outputs the root of the reconstructed tree.</p>

            <p><b>Question 2. </b>(15 min) Given a sorted array of integers, write a function which converts the sorted array into a balanced binary search tree.</p>

            <p><b>Question 3. </b>(10 min) Reverse each word in a given input String.  For example: "I love CS61B" would become "I evol B16SC".</p>

            <p><b>Released: </b>March 30, 2015  (<a href="set3_ans.html">Solutions</a>)</p>

            <p><b>Question 1. </b>(20 min) Write a function which reads a text file and finds the ten most occurring words in the file.</p>

            <p><b>Question 2. </b>(30 min) Write a function which takes as input a tree and returns a list of all duplicate subtrees.  For example: </p>

            <pre>
Input:    1         Output: [ 2  ,  3  ]
         / \                [  \       ]
        2   2               [   3      ]
         \   \
          3   3
