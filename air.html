            <h1>Airline Stuff</h1>
            <p>Will eventually add stuff here, but for now, how I rank the various airlines I've flown.  Last updated: July 2018.</p>
            
            <h2>Long-Haul Economy (Full-Service)</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><p><b>Asiana Airlines.</b>  Best food I've had in economy - bibimbap, steak, a delicious chili sauce fish with rice.  I flew their ancient 777s; their A350s should be significantly nicer!</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Cathay Pacific.</b>  Note I haven't flown them since 2012, and quite a bit has changed since then.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Air New Zealand.</b>  Excellent food and service.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>ANA.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>Swiss.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>Turkish Airlines.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>Scandinavian.</b>  Note that you're entitled to <i>one</i> non-alcoholic drink for the duration of your flight.  This is probably the stingiest among the legacy carriers I've seen.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Air Canada.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>British Airways.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>United Airlines.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>Aeroflot.</b></p></li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Long-Haul Economy (Low Cost)</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><p><b>Norwegian.</b>  They fly new 787s, offer a reasonable selection of complimentary in-flight entertainment, power outlets at every seat, free water, free seat selection at check-in, and decent legroom considering they're a budget carrier.  To be honest, a great value way to cross the Atlantic and by far the most reasonable of the low cost carriers.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Wow Air.</b>  Their A330s are reasonable and come with power outlets.  Legroom was surprisingly good, but nothing is included in your fare.  Hand luggage allowance is the stingiest of any airline I've flown, as you are only allowed a small personal item for free.</p></li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Short-Haul Economy (Full-Service, Non-US)</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><p><b>Cathay Pacific.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>ANA.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>Air Canada.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>Swiss.</b></p></li>            
              <li><p><b>Turkish Airlines.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>Lufthansa.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>Croatia Airlines.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>Aeroflot.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>British Airways.</b></p></li>
              <li><p><b>Arkia Israeli Airlines.</b></p></li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Short-Haul Economy (Full Service, US Domestic)</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><p><b>jetBlue Airways.</b>  I mostly fly on their premium transcontinental routes (i.e. SFO-JFK), and they fly their new A321 aircraft.  These are the best: large TV screens, unlimited snacks, friendly service, the most legroom, and free wi-fi.  My favorite way to fly across the country.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Virgin America.</b>  I know they've now been absorbed by Alaska Airlines, but the seats are comfortable and service among the best.  Their planes also look really nice. :-)</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Alaska Airlines.</b>  My current preferred airline for most of my domestic travel since their mileage program is excellent.  Onboard service is usually super friendly, and the seats tend to be pretty new with good legroom.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Hawaiian Airlines.</b>  This is a longer-haul carrier, but they are nice because they still serve free hot meals in economy.  Service is excellent, but they rank lower here because the old 767 aircraft I flew was really old, which also meant no power outlets for the five hour flight to Hawaii...</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Delta Airlines.</b>  Of the Big 3, Delta has the nicest economy experience on average.  Power outlets and entertainment are good, and the legroom is not bad.  It's also good that their basic economy tickets still let you bring a full-size carry-on bag!  I tend not to fly Delta though because SkyMiles are awful, and they tend to require me to connect.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Southwest Airlines.</b>  Southwest service is among the best!  I rank them lower though because they don't have power outlets or assigned seating, and I don't make use of their luggage allowance.  Solid carrier, just need to know that they do things a bit differently.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>United Airlines.</b>  I've actually never really had problems with United.  Usually nothing memorable, both good and bad.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>AirTran Airways.</b>  I used to like flying them because they were <i>very</i> cheap to fly across the country if you were willing to connect in Atlanta.  Seats were cramped though, but a good value overall!  (Defunct)</p></li>
              <li><p><b>American Airlines.</b>  I don't like flying American Airlines.  Pre-merger US Airways aircraft are the worst: no power outlets, dirty planes with seats that are half falling apart, and very hit-or-miss service.  Pre-merger American aircraft can be nice, but unfortunately American is reconfiguring them to be the stingiest with legroom among the US Big 4.</p></li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Short-Haul Economy (Low Cost)</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><p><b>Norwegian.</b>  Seats are pretty comfortable considering they're a budget carrier, and there's [slow] free wifi.  Luggage allowance is relatively generous.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Scoot.</b>  Seats aren't the most comfortable, and even power outlets come with a charge!  Generous hand luggage allowance of 10kg.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>easyJet.</b>  Seats are probably the most cramped, but good value.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Jetstar Pacific.</b>  Seats were pretty cramped.  Nothing to write home about.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Vueling.</b>  By far my least favorite European low-cost carrier.  The planes are relatively dirty, lax enforcement of luggage allowance means the overhead bins are overflowing, disorganized boarding process, and as we were boarding, announcements kept going off about not fastening seatbelts because the plane was being refuelled.</p></li>
